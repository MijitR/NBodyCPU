# NBodyCPU
CPU n-body stress test

Coppied directly from my NetBeans projects folder
(not sure how to do this still)

The variable controlling the number of bodies is in the NPlane.java file
The variable controlling whether to run a basic simulation instead of a stress test is which method is called in NPlaneTesting (plane.fly() instead of plane.flyFree())

Let me know how many fps you pull in the defualt config. I'm just shy of 60 on my 1185G7
Measures total running average fps so it will steady out.
